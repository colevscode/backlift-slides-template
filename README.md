## What is this

This is a template for Backlift (www.backlift.com). It provides a boilerplate for creating nice HTML-based slide decks.

### A few notes:
- Slides placed in the slides folder will be included in the presentation.
- Numbers in the filename will determine the slide order.
- Slide styles are fully configurable, just check out the styles/style.less file.
- Create slides with either HTML or Markdown.
- The alphabetic portion of markdown file names determines the slide URL.
	- ex: 040_markdown.md --> `https://my.backliftapp.com/#markdown`

### TODO

It's still work in progress. Currently there's a nice basic layouts, but for example following functionality is missing:
- embeddable forms using Backlift backend (e.g. collecting emails)
- another starting template, with light colors
- more and more general purpose templates, that would be easier to use
- improve plotting library
